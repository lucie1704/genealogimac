# genealogIMAC

Genealogimac is a project done with fellow IMAC students in 2022.   
The purpose was to be able to use routing to work with a database.  
genealogIMAC is about the mentor-mentee relashionship between students from different promotions. It usually happens that for every new promotion, every student is assigned a mentor that will be the refered student to ask for help or advice on various subject from school lessons and exams to more social and friendly aspects.  
All new coming students getting a mentor and their mentor themselves having their own mentor we decided to work around this theme to try and find every student's family tree throughout the different generations.  
The database used here is made of random generated names in order to share it publicly.  
Displayed features are in french but the entire code is written and commented in english. I refer to mentor as 'godFather' (parrain or marraine in french) and mentee as 'godChild' ( fillot or fillote)

### how to use the given database with this project 

The sql file is included in the folder as 'genealogimac.sql', import it in your sql environnement (I personnaly used phpMyAdmin).  
The file 'php/connection.php' should be edited with your own database username and password to access the imported data.  
If the students aren't displayed then proceed to import the one named 'genealogimac_iso-8859-1'
